Wandering on the streets of Manhattan, ever wondered why a crowd is gathered around cameras? What’s filming? Are there any stars present? Will I ever get to see the new Superman movie filming in New York (Metropolis)? Have I no choice but to leave it up to fate?

Whenever there’s a filming in New York, there are posters (usually purple) put up in the area. They look like no parking posters, but indicate an alias name and production house for the movie being filmed. We intend to use this vital information to allow people to share knowledge about a movie filming they’ve sighted, and be be able to keep track of movie filmings of their interest. To give a complete experience, users are presented with auxiliary information about the movie such as actors, pictures of the movie etc. using RottenTomatoes.com as the information source.

Our application, PurplePoster, allows users to keep track of and be alerted to movies and shows that are being filmed in the NYC area. Like GasBuddy, our system relies on collaborative reporting of information, i.e. users posting sightings of the purple posters announcing filming in the area. Our system then uses the open data from RottenTomatoes.com to pull ancillary information such as actors, genre, etc., related to this film specified on the poster. This data is used to display information for a film when users want to view the information about the filming. The data is also used to alert other users who are interested in movies matching certain criteria that a movie they might be interested in will be filming near them. Another feature is users being able to add alert preferences, such as alerting a user when a favorite actor is filming in the area. Since we want users to be able to leave feedback about the movie filmings and share their experience, the application has a comments feature where users can leave comments about purple posters on the website. Although we have set up our first prototype as a web application, this idea could eventually be migrated into a mobile application (However, the web application has been optimized for mobile viewing, and resizes/is displayed properly on mobile devices)
